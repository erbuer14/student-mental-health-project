Exploratory analysis of student mental health data completed as part of a DataCamp project.

# Student Mental Health Analysis

This repository contains my first exploratory data analysis project focusing on student mental health.  
The project was completed using DataCamp's DataLab environment and includes:

- `notebook.ipynb`: the full analysis notebook
- `students.csv`: the dataset used
- Image from the project description

This project will be refined over time as I continue learning SQL, Python, and data visualization.
