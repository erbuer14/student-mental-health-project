# Student Mental Health Analysis

This repository contains an early exploratory data analysis project focusing on student mental health.
The project was completed using DataCamp's DataLab environment and analyzes mental health outcomes
among international students by length of stay.

## Repository Structure

- `analysis.sql`  
  Final, documented SQL queries analyzing mental health, social connectedness, and acculturative stress
  among international students by length of stay.

- `data_quality_checks.sql`  
  Validation queries used to assess missing values, score completeness, and key data distributions
  prior to analysis.

- `notebook.ipynb`  
  Exploratory analysis and intermediate work, including early queries and investigation steps.

- `students.csv`  
  Source dataset used for this analysis.

## Notes

This project will be refined over time as I continue developing my skills in SQL, Python,
and data visualization.
